# SummerProject2016

## Description

This is a collaboration project for the summer of 2016 to be advanced amongst a few contributors from the 2016 Spring
semester Object-Oriented Programming course taken in the University of Tartu. The idea is to make a library of games
with a system for users to log into, chat and play.

##Motivation
